# Data Visualization Project


## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is [USA carrier on-time performance data](https://gist.github.com/Echo226/d58e972330148cb6e55c8d4ab2496215). It was collected from **United States Department of Transportation** and preprocessed with Python.



## Prototypes

I've created two visualization prototypes of this dataset.


This is a map showing the location of all airports in USA. Each circle represents one airport.

This is a radial chart and it shows the

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

- How does USA flights' on-time performance vary over time?
- What are the top-5 busiest flights for different airports?
- How are the top-5 busiest flights perform for different airports?


## Interactions:

- There will be a dropdown box called "time" containing four options: DAY_OF_MONTH, WEEKDAY, MONTH and DATE. Clicking on these different options will show the USA Flight On-time Performance in different time aspects.
- There will be another dropdown box containing "departure" and "arrival" and it will show the departure performance and arrival performance seperately.

## Sketches

#### Sketch 1

Using bar chart to show the most busiest airport for each State. Clicking on airport name brings us to top-10  busiest flights for that airport.

#### Sketch 2

Data is visualized geographically.

#### Sketch 3

Data is visualized by time to answer question "How does USA carriers' on-time performance vary over time?".
